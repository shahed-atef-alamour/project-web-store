        <h3>How do you maintain your accessories?</h3>
        </p>
        <div class="advantage">

            <p> Accessories change color when exposed to moisture, chemicals, wear and tear for long periods, and a
                message
                from
                these steps that protect your accessories from discoloration as well as the appearance of green or black
                marks
                on your skin due to wear.

                Reasons for changing the color of accessories
                They are compatible with each other. Expose accessories to moisture, chemicals, or compounds for a long
                time.</p>



            <p>1- Exposing your accessories to moisture or getting wet, but rather the reason for this washing of hands
                or
                face, is considered one of the main reasons for changing the color of the accessory.</p>
            <p>2- Apply two layers of high-quality transparent nail polish on the inner side of the metal accessories,
                which
                will be in contact with the skin.</p>
            <mark>
                <span>
                    <h5>Note: You can use clear nail polish on the entire piece if it is made entirely of metal
                        (stainless
                        steel,
                        brass,
                        silver, bronze, etc.). Also make sure that it is free of precious stones and crystals.</h5>
                </span></mark></p>


            <p> 3- Make sure to wear accessories before leaving the house directly so that they are not exposed to
                creams,
                makeup, hair sprays, perfumes or any cosmetic product that contains chemicals so that they do not get
                damaged or
                change color.</p>
            <p>4- Another important way to protect accessories from discoloration is to keep them in tightly closed
                places
                such
                as lined boxes, and make sure that they are not constantly exposed to the open air.</p>


            <p> 5- Try to store your accessories in an organized way, to avoid the pieces rubbing against each other,
                such
                as
                placing dividers between them or using small envelopes for each accessory. Also, try to classify them
                according
                to materials, i.e. put silverware together, copper together, and so on.</p>


            <p> 6- Make sure to clean your accessories regularly, so that they do not deposit any impurities that help
                them
                change color or damage quickly.</p>
